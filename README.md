### Domain of Interest

_Data driven questions:_
Our domain of interest is music. We're hoping to visualize information
about the music industry and visualize the information in a way that
allows a user to learn more about their music taste. We hope to answer
questions such as:
1. How is music genre related to popularity?
2. Does geography/region influence music production/consumption?
3. Which regions of the world produce the most popular music?
4. How common is an individual's music taste compared to their age
    group or their geographic location?
5. How does an individual's music taste change over time?

_Projects related to this domain:_
1. [A Computational Study of Patterned Melodic Structures Across Musical Cultures](http://www.midasmusictheory.org/) -This project aims to combine computational analysis and music theory. This will be done to compare music across six cultures, including Indian songs, in order to identify common ground in how music is generated and structured in different cultures.
