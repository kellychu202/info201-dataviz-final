### Domain of Interest

_Data driven questions:_
Our domain of interest is music. We're hoping to visualize information
about the music industry and visualize the information in a way that
allows a user to learn more about their music taste. We hope to answer
questions such as: 
- 1. How is music genre related to popularity?
- 2. Does geography/region influence music production/consumption?
- 3. Which regions of the world produce the most popular music?
- 4. How common is an individual's music taste compared to their age
    group or their geographic location?
- 5. How does an individual's music taste change over time?
